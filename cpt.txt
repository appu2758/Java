Explanation
Let’s call Annabelle’s age A and Jason’s age J.

Annabelle is four years older than Jason, so 
1. A=J+4

Six years ago, Annabelle was twice as old as Jason was. 
2. A-6=2×(J-6)

If you replace A with J+4 we will have:
J+4-6=2×(J-6)

If you subtract 6 from four and open the parentheses you will get:
J-2=2J-12

If you add 12 to each side and subtract J from each side, you will get: 
10=J

Jason is therefore 10 years old.
